# Fake-News-Detection

### About Fake News:
A type of yellow journalism, fake news encapsulates pieces of news that may be hoaxes and is generally spread through social media and other online media. This is often done to further or impose certain ideas and is often achieved with political agendas. Such news items may contain false and/or exaggerated claims, and may end up being viralized by algorithms, and users may end up in a filter bubble.

### About TfidfVectorizer:
**TF (Term Frequency):** The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency. A higher value means a term appears more often than others, and so, the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.

**IDF (Inverse Document Frequency):** Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. IDF is a measure of how significant a term is in the entire corpus.
The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.

### About PassiveAggressiveClassifier:
Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms. Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification outcome, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting. Unlike most other algorithms, it does not converge. Its purpose is to make updates that correct the loss, causing very little change in the norm of the weight vector.

## About Detection of Fake News using Python
This is a Advanced Python Project which deals with fake and real news. Using sklearn, we build a TfidfVectorizer on our dataset. Then, we initialize a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fit the model. In the end, the accuracy score and the confusion matrix tell us how well our model fares.

## About Dataset
-Dataset has a shape of 7769×4
- Column 1 : Identifies the News
- Column 2 : Title of News
- Column 3 : Text of News
- Column 4 : Labels denoting whether the news is REAL or FAKE.

## Libraries Used

- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

## Conclusion
Using a political dataset, implemented a TfidfVectorizer, initialized a PassiveAggressiveClassifier, and fit our model. We ended up obtaining an accuracy of **92.13%** in magnitude.
